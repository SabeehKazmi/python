Greetings!
This is the learning material I am gathering for my own reference by following the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" link (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
If you want to learn python join me and I will surely help you learn it and what I will get in return is expereince doing so.
Thank you!
